# Machine-learning
Machine learning and data science have become my new favorite subjects in the realm of coding. The study of these types of algorithms and functions has opened my eyes to 
what a machine can actually do, and I know I am only scratching the surface. Data visualization, class predictions and group clustering are an extremely resourceful tool
to have in the marketplace for an engineer, and I plan on becoming a master of these techniques.
This repository represents some of the assignments and projects I have done during the semester. They are, what I consider, my most interesting work and I hope you find it interesting
as well.
This is a collection of some of my machine learning work. Enjoy!!
